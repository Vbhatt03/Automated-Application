How to use:


1. Create a .env file and fill in all the required credentials. Essential step, the applier wont work without this(Open both the scripts in src to see all the websites that are used).



2. Modify the resume keywords in Job_applier.py as per your resume.



3. Open job_with_status.xlsx to check the jobs that have been auto applied to and that you need to manually apply for.
